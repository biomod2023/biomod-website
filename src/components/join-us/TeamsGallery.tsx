They are involved throughout the entire process, from conducting literature reviews and writing protocols to performing experiments, analyzing data, and producing final reports. They also collaborate closely with the computational and modeling team to develop new projects through literature searches and client reviews. In the past, we have conducted experiments involving cell culture, bacterial work, drug delivery, DNA origami, among others. If you are interested in participating in the entire scientific process, consider joining our wetlab team!",

The results from our dry lab are crucial as they support our wetlab experiments and help determine whether we should proceed with certain experiments. The team uses a variety of software and programming languages, such as Biopython, COMSOL, Marvin, and Swiss, to achieve their results. If you are interested in computational biology, AI, modeling, and learning different software, the computational and modeling team is the right fit for you!",
